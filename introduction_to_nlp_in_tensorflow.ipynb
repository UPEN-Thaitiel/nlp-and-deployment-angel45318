        "The main goal of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32) is to derive information from natural language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural language is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:\n",
        "* Text (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)\n",
        "* Speech (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)\n",

        "Under the umbrellas of text and speech there are many different things you might want to do.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "If you're trying to analyse customer feedback complaints, you might want to discover which section of your business they're for.\n",
        "\n",
        "> 🔑 **Note:** Both of these types of data are often referred to as *sequences* (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called *seq2seq*, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",
        "\n",
        "To get hands-on with NLP in TensorFlow, we're going to practice the steps we've used previously but this time with text data:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)\n",
        "```\n",

        "* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
        "  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
        "  2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
        "  3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple **tokens**.\n",
        "* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings: \n",
        "  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
        "  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n",

You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)). \n",

        "Since we're working with a classification problem, there are a few of ways we can combine our models:\n",

        "2. **Majority vote (mode)** - Make class predictions with each of your models on all samples, the predicted class is the one in majority. For example, if three different models predict `[1, 0, 1]` respectively, the majority class is `1`, therefore, that would be the predicted label.\n",
